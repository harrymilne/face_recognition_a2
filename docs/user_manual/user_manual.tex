\subsection{System Installation}
If you do not already have the files they are available for download at: \url{https://github.com/harrymilne/face_recognition_a2}
This repository has two root folders, `code' and `docs', Python files for the running of the client and server are under code.
Once you are in the code directory this then has 3 folders, `client', `db\_browser' and `server', the `server' and `db\_browser'
folders need to be on the same computer, whereas the client needs to be placed on a computer with access to a network capable of
connecting to the computer which has the `server' and `db\_browser' folders on. 

\subsubsection{Client}
The client software must be installed anywhere you want end-users to be able to control the system, the code can be ran on a 
raspberry pi or on a `normal computer'. 
The client (face recognition) requires a Python package called SimpleCV, to install this you must first 
download the `superpack' from simplecv.org/download. This installs all of the dependencies you need for the client program.

After downloading and installing the relevant `superpack' for your system, you can run the client with Python version 2.7.
