\section{Introduction}

    The intended audience of this system is a normal household, in this case it is Paul Milne's household. Paul himself is very experienced
    in computing, however the rest of the household have an average IT knowledge.

    The purpose of the system is to provide an easy method to interface with the alarms; to turn them on and off.
\section{Installation}
    \subsection{Prerequisite Installation}

    \subsection{System Installation}
        If you do not already have the files they are available for download at: \url{https://github.com/harrymilne/face_recognition_a2}.
        This repository has two root folders, `code' and `docs', Python files for the running of the client and server are under code.
        Once you are in the code directory this then has 3 folders, `client', `db\_browser' and `server', the `server' and `db\_browser'
        folders need to be on the same computer, whereas the client needs to be placed on a computer with access to a network capable of
        connecting to the computer which has the `server' and `db\_browser' folders on. 

    \subsubsection{Client}
        The client software must be installed anywhere you want end-users to be able to control the system, the code can be ran on a 
        raspberry pi or on a `normal computer'. 
        The client (face recognition) requires a Python package called SimpleCV, to install this you must first 
        download the `superpack' from simplecv.org/download (shown in figure~\ref{fig:simplecv}).  This installs all of the dependencies you need for the client program.

        \begin{figure}[H]

            \label{fig:simplecv}
        \end{figure}

        The files included with the downloaded repository will include an example configuration file called `client.cfg'. As shown
        below in figure~\ref{lst:clientcfg}, this must but set to use values that suite your system needs. To find the `haar\_cascade'
        path you must find where your Python installation resides and check `dist-packages' for the `SimpleCV' folder, then it should
        be under `Features/HaarCascades' as of version 1.3.

        \begin{figure}[H]

            \label{lst:clientcfg}
        \end{figure}

        After downloading and installing the relevant `superpack' for your system, you can run the client with Python version 2.7.
