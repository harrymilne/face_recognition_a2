[Harry: What kind of features did you expect the system to include?]
[Paul: The system needs to at least allow users to interact with the alarm system.]
[Harry: Is the system quick and easy for users?]
[Paul: The authentication of users is most of the time a lot quicker than using a PIN set up]
[Harry: How is setting up the system?]
[Paul: It isn't the easiest thing in the world, I think it needs a lot of work.]
[Harry: Does the system work over your network?]
[Paul: Yes, the server and client successfully talk to each other over the network.]
[Harry: Does the system store logs and users in the SQLite database?]
[Paul: After using the system for a day I could see the correct data being stored.]
[Harry: How well does the client recognise faces?]
[Paul: It's not great, sometimes it can take a while for it to position yourself correctly in relation to the camera.]
[Harry: Does the client successfully differentiate between each user?]
[Paul: Yes, the system does work in a multi-user environment.]
[Harry: Does the system successfully turn the alarms off and on?]
[Paul: Yes]
[Harry: Was the database browser effective?]
[Paul: The user interface was intuitive; similar to existing software.]
[Harry: How is the overall experience with the system?]
[Paul: It could do with a lot of polishing; most of the scripts are raw without any find of proper user interface. However, the user manual does give a basic overview on how to use these tools.]
[Harry: What aspects of the system do you think need the most work?]
[Paul: User interface and improving the face recognition.]
