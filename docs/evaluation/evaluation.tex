\section{Customer Requirements}
	
	\subsection{General Objectives}
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Quick and easy to use method of user verification

			The program allows an easy method to toggle the alarm system successfully, all the user has
			to do is let the program scan their face, therefore this objective has been met. \textit{[Evidence]}

			\item Easy additional user set-up

			Setting up users with the client currently requires a function within the code to be ran,
			this is within the ability of the user but it is hard to call it `easy'. However, the database
			has a user interface which works correctly and adding users is very easy. \textit{[Evidence]}

			\item Communication with the server over the network

			The client correctly communicates back and forth with the server across a network. \textit{[Evidence]}
 
			\item Store users and access logs in a SQL database

			Users and logs are stored on the server in an SQL database, this database is only controlled
			by the system administrator. \textit{[Evidence]}
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Specific Objectives}

		\paragraph{User Verification}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Ability to recognize faces

				The client successfully detects that a face is within the camera region, the `SimpleCV' package
				handles this very well.

				\item Ability to tell different faces from others
				
				After matching the input with the saved files, the client can correctly match an input face with a
				user that has previously been stored on the file system. \textit{[Evidence]}

				\item Must be able to match a name to that face

				Images of the users are saved to the system with the file name as the user's name, this means there is
				no further processing to find the user's name after the input has been matched with a file. \textit{[Evidence]}
			\end{itemize}

		\paragraph{User Set-up}

			\begin{itemize}
				\item UI to edit each user or add users

				A database UI has been created for the server, however there is no user interface for the client, so I would
				say this objective is partially met.
				
				\item Power user tools

				The set-up allows raw access to the SQLite database, however, there are no power user tools coded into any of
				the system.
			\end{itemize}

		\paragraph{Network Communication}
		
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Access to local area network
				\item Receive commands and send commands
				\item Secure
			\end{itemize}

		\paragraph{SQL Database}
		
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Table containing each user
				\item Access logs with a relationship to a user
				\item Secure interface with communicating to the database
			\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Core Objectives}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item User verification via face recognition
			\item Interface with the server
			\item Server to turn the alarms on and off
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Other Objectives}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Socket encryption
			\item Control over what time slots people are allowed to turn alarms off
			\item Ability to edit users from different computers
		\end{itemize}
